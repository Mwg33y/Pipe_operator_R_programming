# Pipe_operator_R_programming

**The pipe operator**
The pipe operator can be  placed between operations in R to both keep them seperate
and in one body. It allows us to perform methods on objects without needing variables 
to store the intermediate results. It is a way of keeping cleaner appearing code that 
is easier to follow and understand.

Here I use the pipe operator to group the used_car dataframe by car brand, 
count the number of used cars for each brand, find the average 
price for each car brand, and filter out any brand that has a 
count less than 100.
